# LFGPlant Introduce

LFG Plant is a protocol dedicated to providing content creation tokenization using ai. Create2 generates NFT for user content while tokenizing the content. Creators can put their content into any DEX that supports ERC20 and provide liquidity to turn it into a MEME with a real content culture. The creator can also sell the NFT of his corresponding content to any market that supports NFT. (One interesting thing is that when a person holds 51% of the content ERC20 Token, he will have the ownership to change the original content NFT ID).
